2,2008-08-01T19:36:46Z, p i ve read somewhere the human eye can t distinguish between less than values apart so this is something to keep in mind the following algorithm does not compensate for this p p i m not sure this is exactly what you want but this is one way to randomly generate non repeating color values p p beware inconsistent pseudo code ahead p pre code colors entered as r g b br colors holds final colors to be used br rand new random br br assumes n is less than br randomgen int n br while len colors lt n br generate a random number between for each color br newred rand next br newgreen rand next br newblue rand next br temp newred newgreen newblue br only adds new colors to the array br if temp not in colors br colors append temp br br br br code pre p one way you could optimize this for better visibility would be to compare the distance between each new color and all the colors in the array p pre code for item in color br itemsq item item item br tempsq temp temp temp br dist itemsq tempsq br dist abs dist br br number can be your chosen distance apart br if dist lt number and temp not in colors br colors append temp br br code pre p but this approach would significantly slow down your algorithm p p another way would be to scrap the randomness and systematically go through every values and add a color to an array in the above example p 
3,2008-08-01T23:49:57Z, p yes i thought about that but i soon figured out that another domain specific language dsl would be a bit too much p p essentially they need to interact with my gamestate in possibly unpredictable ways for example a card could have a rule when this cards enter play all your undead minions gain attack against flying enemies except when the enemy is blessed as trading card games are turn based the gamestate manager will fire onstagex events and let the cards modify other cards or the gamestate in whatever way the card needs p p if i try to create a dsl i have to implement a rather large feature set and possibly constantly update it which shifts the maintenance work to another part without actually removing it p p that s why i wanted to stay with a real net language to essentially be able to just fire the event and let the card manipulate the gamestate in whatever way within the limits of the code access security p

5,2008-08-02T03:00:24Z, p i would be a bit reluctant to use nested classes here what if you created an abstract base class for a multimedia driver to handle the back end stuff workhorse and a separate class for the front end work the front end class could take a pointer reference to an implemented driver class for the appropriate media type and situation and perform the abstract operations on the workhorse structure p p my philosophy would be to go ahead and make both structures accessible to the client in a polished way just under the assumption they would be used in tandem p p i would reference something like a a href http qt project org doc qt qtextdocument html qtextdocument a in qt you provide a direct interface to the bare metal data handling but pass the authority along to an object like a qtextedit to do the manipulation p 
6,2008-08-02T04:18:15Z, p you might be able to use ironruby for that p p otherwise i d suggest you have a directory where you place precompiled assemblies then you could have a reference in the db to the assembly and class and use reflection to load the proper assemblies at runtime p p if you really want to compile at run time you could use the codedom then you could use reflection to load the dynamic assembly a href http msdn microsoft com en us library microsoft csharp csharpcodeprovider aspx msdn article which might help a p 
7,2008-08-02T06:16:23Z, p you could use any of the dlr languages which provide a way to really easily host your own scripting platform however you don t have to use a scripting language for this you could use c and compile it with the c code provider as long as you load it in its own appdomain you can load and unload it to your heart s content p 
8,2008-08-02T15:33:13Z, p no what you re doing is fine don t let those people confuse you p p if you ve written the web services with net then the reference proxies generated by net are going to be quite suitable the situation you describe where you are both producer and consumer is the ideal situation p p if you need to connect to a web services that is em unknown em at compile time then you would want a more dynamic approach where you deduce the shape of the web service p p but start by using the auto generated proxy class and don t worry about it until you hit a limitation and when you do come back to stack overflow p 
9,2008-08-02T18:16:07Z, p isn t it also a factor which order you set up the colors p p like if you use dillie os idea you need to mix the colors as much as possible is from one to the next but in a wheel would be more apart p p does this make sense p 
10,2008-08-02T19:03:52Z, p my first thought on this is how generate n vectors in a space that maximize distance from each other you can see that the rgb or any other scale you use that forms a basis in color space are just vectors take a look at a href http mathworld wolfram com topics randompointpicking html random point picking a hope this is a good start for you once you have a set of vectors that are maximized a part you can save them in a hash table or something for later and just perform random rotations on them to get all the colors you desire that are maximally apart from each other p p strong edit strong thinking about this problem more it would be better to map the colors in a linear manor possibly lexicographically and then distribute them evenly i really don t know how well this will work but it should since lets say p p n we know we have colors we can use a href http stackoverflow com questions using combinations of sets as test data buckles algorithm a to find the lexicographically indexed color img src http i stack imgur com geucs gif alt frac binom n i you ll probably have to edit the algorithm to avoid overflow and probably add some minor speed improvements p 
11,2008-08-02T23:40:04Z, p for my projects i alternate between sql compare from red gate and the database publishing wizard from microsoft which you can download free a href http www microsoft com downloads details aspx familyid e b c bf e a a e a amp displaylang en here a p p the wizard isn t as slick as sql compare or sql data compare but it does the trick one issue is that the scripts it generates may need some rearranging and or editing to flow in one shot p p on the up side it can move your schema and data which isn t bad for a free tool p 
12,2008-08-02T23:51:09Z, p i ve taken to hand coding all of my ddl creates alter delete statements adding them to my sln as text files and using normal versioning using subversion but any revision control should work this way i not only get the benefit of versioning but updating live from dev stage is the same process for code and database tags branches and so on work all the same p p otherwise i agree redgate is expensive if you don t have a company buying it for you if you can get a company to buy it for you though it really is worth it p 
13,2008-08-03T00:22:03Z, p if you have a company buying it toad from quest software has this kind of management functionality built in it s basically a two click operation to compare two schemas and generate a sync script from one to the other p p they have editions for most of the popular databases including of course sql server p 
14,2008-08-03T00:37:03Z, p i work the same way karl does by keeping all of my sql scripts for creating and altering tables in a text file that i keep in source control in fact to avoid the problem of having to have a script examine the live database to determine what alters to run i usually work like this p ul li on the first version i place everything during testing into one sql script and treat all tables as a create this means i end up dropping and readding tables a lot during testing but that s not a big deal early into the project since i m usually hacking the data i m using at that point anyway li li on all subsequent versions i do two things i make a new text file to hold the upgrade sql scripts that contain just the alters for that version and i make the changes to the original create a fresh database script as well this way an upgrade just runs the upgrade script but if we have to recreate the db we don t need to run scripts to get there li li depending on how i m deploying the db changes i ll also usually put a version table in the db that holds the version of the db then rather than make any human decisions about which scripts to run whatever code i have running the create upgrade scripts uses the version to determine what to run li ul p the one thing this will not do is help if part of what you re moving from test to production is data but if you want to manage structure and not pay for a nice but expensive db management package is really not very difficult i ve also found it s a pretty good way of keeping mental track of your db p 
15,2008-08-03T01:38:02Z, p i agree that scripting everything is the best way to go and is what i advocate at work you should script everything from db and object creation to populating your lookup tables p p anything you do in ui only won t translate especially for changes not so much for first deployments and will end up requiring a tools like what redgate offers p 
16,2008-08-03T11:41:38Z, p with the built in stuff you can t as using or will replace the revision and build numbers with a coded date timestamp which is usually also a good way p p for more info see the a href http msdn microsoft com en us library c shex vs aspx assembly linker a documentation in the v tag p p as for automatically incrementing numbers use the assemblyinfo task p p a href http code msdn microsoft com assemblyinfotaskvers assemblyinfo task a p p this can be configured to automatically increment the build number p p there are gotchas p ol li each of the numbers in the version string is limited to this is a windows limitation and unlikely to get fixed ul li a href http blogs msdn com msbuild archive why are build numbers limited to aspx why are build numbers limited to a li ul li li using with with subversion requires a small change ul li a href http www andrewconnell com blog archive aspx using msbuild to generate assembly version info at build time including subversion fix a li ul li ol p retrieving the version number is then quite easy p pre code version v assembly getexecutingassembly getname version string about string format cultureinfo invariantculture yourapp version r v major v minor v build v revision code pre hr p and to clarify in net or at least in c the build is actually the third number not the fourth one as some people for example delphi developers who are used to major minor release build might expect p p in net it s major minor build revision p 
17,2008-08-03T18:46:33Z, p what source control system are you using p p almost all of them have some form of id tag that gets expanded when the file is checked in p p i usually use some form of hackery to display this as the version number p p the other alternative is use to use the date as the build number p

19,2008-08-03T20:48:47Z, p first yes this is something that belongs in the application for the exact reson you specified what happens after new user profiles are created sure if you re using a domain it s possible to have some stuff put in the registry on creation but this is not really a use case the application should check if there are seetings and use the default settings if not p p that being said it is possible to change other users keys through the hkey_users hive p p i have no experience with the visual studio setup project so here is a bit of totally unrelated vbscript code that might just give you an idea where to look p pre code const hkey_users amp h br strcomputer br set objreg getobject winmgmts impersonationlevel impersonate amp strcomputer amp root default stdregprov br strkeypath br objreg enumkey hkey_users strkeypath arrsubkeys br strkeypath software microsoft windows currentversion wintrust trust providers software publishing br for each subkey in arrsubkeys br objreg setdwordvalue hkey_users subkey amp strkeypath state br next br code pre p code courtesy of a href http jritmeijer spaces live com blog cns a a fb a entry rel nofollow jeroen ritmeijer a p 
20,2008-08-03T21:17:33Z, p i m guessing that because you want to set it for all users that you re on some kind of shared computer which is probably running under a domain p p strong here be dragons strong p p let s say joe and jane regularly log onto the computer then they will each have registries p p you ll then install your app and the installer will employ giant hacks and disgusting things to set items under hkcu for them p p then bob will come along and log on he and other people have accounts in the domain and so can do this he s never used this computer before so he has no registry the first time he logs in windows creates him one but he won t have your setting p p your app then falls over or behaves incorrectly and bob complains loudly about those crappy products from raynixon incorporated p p the correct answer is to just have some default settings in your app which can write them to the registry if it doesn t find them it s general good practice that your app should never depend on the registry and should create things as needed for any registry entry not just hkcu anyway p 
21,2008-08-03T22:34:06Z, p despite what the a href http msdn microsoft com en us library x kd c vs aspx rel nofollow msdn article a says about user machine hive it doesn t write to hkey_users rather it writes to hkcu if you select just me and hklm if you select everyone p p so my solution is going to be to use the user machine hive and then in the application it checks if the registry entries are in hkcu and if not copies them from hklm i know this probably isn t the most ideal way of doing it but it has the least amount of changes p

29,2008-08-04T06:15:30Z, p the typical method is as follows you ve said you want to do this in c so here goes p ol li if you don t know which process has the file locked you ll need to examine each process s handle list and query each handle to determine if it identifies the locked file doing this in c will likely require p invoke or an intermediary c cli to call the native apis you ll need li li once you ve figured out which process es have the file locked you ll need to safely inject a small native dll into the process you can also inject a managed dll but this is messier as you then have to start or attach to the net runtime li li that bootstrap dll then closes the handle using closehandle etc li ol p essentially the way to unlock a locked file is to inject a dll into the offending process s address space and close it yourself you can do this using native or managed code no matter what you re going to need a small amount of native code or at least p invoke into the same p p helpful links p ul li a href http www codeproject com kb threads winspy aspx http www codeproject com kb threads winspy aspx a li li a href http damianblog com net code injection http damianblog com net code injection a li ul p good luck p

85,2008-08-05T19:59:05Z, p from the perspective of having the most maintainable code i think you should do as much validation as you can in the setter of a property this way you won t be caching or otherwise dealing with invalid data p p after all this is what properties are meant for if all you have is a bunch of properties like p pre code public string name get return _name set _name value code pre p they might as well be fields p 
86,2008-08-05T19:59:13Z, p it depends p p generally code should fail fast if the value can be set by multiple points in the code and you validate only on after retrieving the value the bug appears to be in the code that does the update if the setters validate the input you know what code is trying to set invalid values p 
87,2008-08-05T19:59:39Z, p well one of the reaons why classes usually contain private members with public getters setters is exactly because they can verify data p p if you have a number than can be between and i would definitely put something in the setter that validates that and then maybe throw an exception that is being caught by the code the reason is simple if you don t do it in the setter you have to remember that to limitation every time you set it which leads to duplicated code or when you forget it it leads to an invalid state p p as for performance i m with knuth here p blockquote p we should forget about small efficiencies say about of the time premature optimization is the root of all evil p blockquote

162,2008-08-07T15:57:16Z, p without doing detailed analysis i d guess that it s faster because of the question marks these allow the regular expression to be lazy and stop as soon as they have enough to match rather than checking if the rest of the input matches p p i m not entirely happy with this answer though because this mostly applies to question marks after or if i were more familiar with the input it might make more sense to me p p also for the code formatting you can select all of your code and press kbd ctrl kbd kbd k kbd to have it add the four spaces required p 
163,2008-08-07T15:58:31Z, p i agree with you in that it is quite an annoyance to me i also copy and paste my address into the second input p p that being said for less savvy users it is probably a good idea watching my mother type is affirmation that many users do not look at the screen when they type when she s using her laptop she resembles linus from peanuts when he s playing the piano if it s important for you to have the user s correct email address then i would say having a confirmation input is a very good idea one of these days i ll probably type my email address wrong in the first box and paste it wrong into the second box and then feel like a complete idiot p 
164,2008-08-07T16:00:04Z, p i would just use one input box the confirm input is a remnant form the confirm password method p p with passwords this is useful because they are usually typed as little circles so you can t just look at it to make sure that you typed it correctly p p with a regular text box you can visually check your input so there is no need for a confirmation input box p 
165,2008-08-07T16:02:00Z, p i agree with justin while most technical folks will use the copy paste method for the less savvy users it is a good practice p p one more thing that i would add is that the second field should have the auto complete feature disabled this ensures that there is human input from either method on at least one of the fields p 
166,2008-08-07T16:16:37Z, p i d say that this is ok but should only be reserved for forms where the email is essential if you mistype your email for your flight booking then you have severed the two way link between yourself and the other party and risk not getting the confirmation number here on stackoverflow it would only mean your gravatar would not be loaded p p i d consider myself fairly techie but i always fill in both fields wo cut paste if i regard it to be important enough p

168,2008-08-07T16:34:49Z, p as long as a field is viewable you do not need a confirm box as long as you do some form validation to be sure that it is at least in valid format for an email address let the user manage the rest of the issues p 
169,2008-08-07T16:36:19Z, p i ve seen plenty of people type their email address wrong and i ve also looked through user databases full of invalid email address p p the way i see it you ve got two options use a second box to confirm the input or send an authentication activation email p p both are annoyances so you get to choose which you think will annoy your users less p p most would argue that having to find an email and click on a link is more annoying but it avoids the copy paste a bad address issue and it allows you to do things like delete or roll back users if they don t activate after say hours p

171,2008-08-07T17:53:38Z, p i m not sure if this would be handled exactly the same way for webstart but we ran into this situation in a desktop application when dealing with a set of native libraries dlls in our case p p loading liba before libb should work unless one of those libraries has a dependency that is unaccounted for and not in the path my understanding is that once it gets to a system loadlibrary call i e java has found the library in its java library path and is now telling the os to load it it is completely dependent on the operating system to find any dependent libraries because at that point it is the operating system that is loading the library for the process and the os only knows how to look in the system path that seems hard to set in the case of a webstart app but there is a way around this that does not involve static compiling you may be able to shuffle where your libraries are i am unsure p p if you use a custom classloader you can override loadlibrary and findlibrary so that it can locate your libraries from within a jar in your classpath and if you also make it aware of your native library dependencies i e libb depends on liba depends on libx then when loading libb you can catch yourself and ensure you load liba first and in checking that notice and load libx first then the os doesn t try to find a library that isn t in your path it s klunky and a bit painful but ensuring java finds them and loads them all in the correct order can work p

189,2008-08-08T03:04:29Z, p when dealing with indexes you have to determine what your table is going to be used for if you are primarily inserting rows a second and not doing any querying then a clustered index is a hit to performance if you are doing queries a second then not having an index will lead to very bad performance the best thing to do when trying to tune queries indexes is to use the query plan analyzer and sql profiler in sql server this will show you where you are running into costly table scans or other performance blockers p p as for the guid vs id argument you can find people online that swear by both i have always been taught to use guids unless i have a really good reason not to jeff has a good post that talks about the reasons for using guids a href http www codinghorror com blog archives html http www codinghorror com blog archives html a p p as with most anything development related if you are looking to improve performance there is not one single right answer it really depends on what you are trying to accomplish and how you are implementing the solution the only true answer is to test test and test again against performance metrics to ensure that you are meeting your goals p p edit matt after doing some more research on the guid id debate i came across this post like i mentioned before there is not a true right or wrong answer it depends on your specific implementation needs but these are some pretty valid reasons to use guids as the primary key p blockquote p for example there is an issue known as a hotspot where certain pages of data in a table are under relatively high currency contention basically what happens is most of the traffic on a table and hence page level locks occurs on a small area of the table towards the end new records will always go to this hotspot because identity is a sequential number generator these inserts are troublesome because they require exlusive page lock on the page they are added to the hotspot this effectively serializes all inserts to a table thanks to the page locking mechanism newid on the other hand does not suffer from hotspots values generated using the newid function are only sequential for short bursts of inserts where the function is being called very quickly such as during a multi row insert which causes the inserted rows to spread randomly throughout the table s data pages instead of all at the end thus eliminating a hotspot from inserts p p also because the inserts are randomly distributed the chance of page splits is greatly reduced while a page split here and there isnt too bad the effects do add up quickly with identity page fill factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one with newid you can actually make use of fill factor as a performance enabling tool you can set fill factor to a level that approximates estimated volume growth between index rebuilds and then schedule the rebuilds during off peak hours using dbcc reindex this effectively delays the performance hits of page splits until off peak times p p if you even em think em you might need to enable replication for the table in question then you might as well make the pk a uniqueidentifier and flag the guid field as rowguidcol replication will require a uniquely valued guid field with this attribute and it will add one if none exists if a suitable field exists then it will just use the one thats there p p yet another huge benefit for using guids for pks is the fact that the value is indeed guaranteed unique not just among all values generated by em this em server but all values generated by em all em computers whether it be your db server web server app server or client machine pretty much every modern language has the capability of generating a valid guid now in net you can use system guid newguid this is very handy when dealing with cached master detail datasets in particular you dont have to employ crazy temporary keying schemes just to relate your records together before they are committed you just fetch a perfectly valid new guid from the operating system for each new record s permanent key value at the time the record is created p p a href http forums asp net t aspx http forums asp net t aspx a p blockquote 
190,2008-08-08T03:04:55Z, p the primary key serves three purposes p ul li indicates that the column s should be unique li li indicates that the column s should be non null li li document the intent that this is the unique identifier of the row li ul p the first two can be specified in lots of ways as you have already done p p the third reason is good p ul li for humans so they can easily see your intent li li for the computer so a program that might compare or otherwise process your table can query the database for the table s primary key li ul p a primary key doesn t have to be an auto incrementing number field so i would say that it s a good idea to specify your guid column as the primary key p

192,2008-08-08T06:25:50Z, p a primary key needn t be an autoincrementing field in many cases this just means you are complicating your table structure p p instead a primary key should be the minimum collection of attributes note that most dbms will allow a composite primary key that uniquely identifies a tuple p p in technical terms it should be the field that every other field in the tuple is fully functionally dependent upon if it isn t you might need to normalise p p in practice performance issues may mean that you merge tables and use an incrementing field but i seem to recall something about premature optimisation being evil p

194,2008-08-08T13:08:40Z, p i guess a fairly big downside is that the extra volume of code that you have to write manage and maintain for a strong small strong project may just be overkill p p it s all down to what s appropriate for the size of the project the expected life of the final project and the budget sometimes whilst doing things properly is appealing doing something a little more lightweight can be the right commercial decision p 
195,2008-08-08T13:18:38Z, p i would be pushing hard for the n tiered approach even if it s a small project if you use an orm tool like codesmith nettiers you will be able to quickly setup the projects and be developing code that solves your business problems quickly p p it kills me when you start a new project and you spend days sitting around spinning wheels talking about how the architecture should be architected you want to be spending time solving the business problem not solving problems that other people have solved for you using an orm it doesn t really matter which one just pick one and stick to it to help you get initial traction will help keep you focussed on the goals of the project and not distract you trying to solve architecture issues p p if at the end of the day the architect wants to go the one project approach there is no reason you can t create an app_code folder with a bll and dal folder to seperate the code for now which will help you move to an n tiered solution later p 
196,2008-08-08T13:58:59Z, p as with anything abstraction creates complexity and so the complexity of doing n tiered should be properly justified e g does n tiered actually benefit the system there em will em be small systems that will work best with n tiered although a lot of them will not p p also even if your system is small at the moment you might want to add more features to it later not going n tiered em might em consitute a sort of technical debt on your part so you have to be careful p

202,2008-08-08T15:46:36Z, p i personally would say email w verification openid is a great idea but i find that finding a provider that your already with is a pain i only had an openid for here cause just days before beta i decided to start a blog on blogspot but everyone on the internet has en email address especially when dealing with businesses people aren t very opt to using there personal blog or whatnot for a business login p 
203,2008-08-08T15:48:06Z, p i think that openid is definitely worth looking at besides giving you a framework in which to provide a unified id for customers it can also provide large businesses with the ability to manage their own logins and provide a common login across all products that they use including your own this isn t that large of a benefit now when openid is still relatively rare but as more products begin to use it i suspect that the ability to use a common company openid login for each employee could become a good selling point p p since you re mostly catering to businesses i don t think that it s all that unreasonable to offer to host the openid accounts yourself i just think that the extra flexibility will benefit your customers p 
204,2008-08-08T15:49:41Z, p openid is very slick and something you should seriously consider as it basically removes the requirement to save local usernames and passwords and worry about authentication p p a lot of sites nowadays are using both openid and their own giving users the option p p if you do decide to roll your own i d recommend using the email address be careful though if you are creating something that groups users by an account say a company that has several users in this case the email address might be used more than once if they do work for more than one company for example and you should allow that p p hth p 
205,2008-08-08T15:54:51Z, p if most of your customers are mostly businesses then i think that using anything other than email creates problems for your customers most people are comfortable with email address login and since they are a business customer will likely want to use their work email rather than a personal account openid creates a situation where there is a third party involved and many businesses don t like a third party involved p 
206,2008-08-08T16:40:43Z, p i ve had to do this before the only real way to do it is to manually match up the various locations use your database s console interface and grouping select statements first add your company name field then p pre code select count as repcount location name from mytable br where company name is null br group by location name br order by repcount desc br limit br code pre p figure out what company the location at the top of the list belongs to and then update your company name field with an update where location name the location statement p p p s you should really break your company names and location names out into separate tables and refer to them by their primary keys p p update wow no duplicates how many records do you have p 
207,2008-08-08T16:41:29Z, p please update the question do you have a list of companynames available to you i ask because you maybe able to use levenshtein algo to find a relationship between your list of companynames and locationnames p hr p strong update strong p blockquote p there is not a list of company names i will have to generate the company name from the most descriptive or best location name that represents the multiple locations p blockquote p okay try this p ol li build a list of candidate companynames by finding locationnames made up of mostly or all alphabetic characters you can use a href http us php net manual en book pcre php rel nofollow regular expressions a for this store this list in a separate table li li sort that list alphabetically and manually determine which entries should be companynames li li compare each companyname to each locationname and come up with a match score use a href http us php net manual en function levenshtein php rel nofollow levenshtein a or some other string matching algo store the result in a separate table li li set a threshold score such that any matchscore lt threshold will not be considered a match for a given companyname li li manually vet through the locationnames by companyname locationname matchscore and figure out which ones actually match ordering by matchscore should make the process less painful li ol p the whole purpose of the above actions is to automate parts and limit the scope of your problem it s far from perfect but will hopefully save you the trouble of going through k records by hand p 
208,2008-08-08T16:44:48Z, p i was going to recommend some complicated token matching algorithm but it s really tricky to get right and if you re data does not have a lot of correlation typos etc then it s not going to give very good results p p i would recommend you submit a job to the a href http www mturk com mturk welcome rel nofollow amazon mechanical turk a and let a human sort it out p 
209,2008-08-08T16:47:35Z, p ideally you d probably want a separate table named company and then a company_id column in this location table that is a foreign key to the company table s primary key likely called id that would avoid a fair bit of text duplication in this table over rows an integer foreign key would save quite a bit of space over a varchar column p p but you re still faced with a method for loading that company table and then properly associating it with the rows in location there s no general solution but you could do something along these lines p ol li create the company table with an id column that auto increments depends on your rdbms li li find all of the unique company names and insert them into company li li add a column company_id to location that accepts nulls for now and that is a foreign key of the company id column li li for each row in location determine the corresponding company and update that row s company_id column with that company s id this is likely the most challenging step if your data is like what you show in the example you ll likely have to take many runs at this with various string matching approaches li li once all rows in location have a company_id value then you can alter the company table to add a not null constraint to the company_id column assuming that every location em must em have a company which seems reasonable li ol p if you can make a copy of your location table you can gradually build up a series of sql statements to populate the company_id foreign key if you make a mistake you can just start over and rerun the script up to the point of failure p

212,2008-08-08T18:09:55Z, p from a high level yes d the main thing is some place to store the templates a database is a great option unless you re not already using one then file systems work fine p p wsiwig editors such as fckeditor work well and give you some good options regarding the features that you allow p p some sort of token replacement system is also a good idea if you need it for example if someone puts firstname in the email template the code that generates the email can do some simple pattern matching to replace known tokens with other known values that may be dynamic based on user or other circumstances p 
213,2008-08-08T18:25:17Z, p i am thinking that if these are automated notifications then this means they are probably going out as a result of some type of event in your software if this is a web based app and you are going to have a number of these being sent out then consider implementing an email queue rather than sending out an email on every event p p a component can query the queue periodically and send out any pending items p

217,2008-08-08T22:07:02Z, p yes that step from my previous post is a doozy p p no matter what you re probably going to have to do some of this by hand but you may be able to automate the bulk of it for the example locations you gave a query like the following would set the appropriate company_id value p pre code update location br set company_id br where lower location_name like to_n shop br or lower location_name like tts br and company_id is null br code pre p i believe that would match your examples i added the code is null code part to not overwrite previously set company_id values but of course in rows you re going to have to be pretty inventive to handle the various combinations p p something else that might help would be to use the names in company to generate queries like the one above you could do something like the following in mysql p pre code select concat update location set company_id br company_id where lower location_name like br lower replace company_name and company_id is null br from company br code pre p then just run the statements that it produces that could do a lot of the grunge work for you p

271,2008-08-11T18:43:51Z, p linq is short for language integrated query it s a set of language enhancements built into c and vb basically what you get is a bunch of standard query operators that can be applied to any ienumerable of type t there s a lot of different linq providers for specific types of data for example there s linq to xml linq to entities even linq to sharepoint p p to get started with linq in all its many forms i suggest the book a href http rads stackoverflow com amzn click rel nofollow title cocoa programming for mac osx pro linq by joseph c rattz a it s an excellent overview of linq he takes a ground up approach first describing all the language features like lambda expressions and expression trees that linq is built on and then moving on to some standard linq provider implementations p p additionally here s a pretty good msdn article describing linq a href http msdn microsoft com en us library bb aspx rel nofollow title using subversion hooks to send out build emails linq net language integrated query a p p now linq to sql is a linq provider written specifically for sql server included in this provider is an or m that gives you some handy dandy functionality like typing out all your sql tables so you get a robust design time view of your database schema it s totally awesome and for me has greatly speed up development time when working with a sql database the book i recommended above also has a great section about using linq to sql also here s a good beginner s guide article from msdn a href http msdn microsoft com en us library bb aspx linqtosql_topic rel nofollow linq to sql net language integrated query for relational data a p

274,2008-08-11T19:20:29Z, p trust me you will spend more money trying to search develop a solution for this as compared to buying a third party component do not reinvent the wheel and go for the paid solution p p printing is a complex problem and i would love to see the day when better framework support is added for this p 
275,2008-08-11T19:59:34Z, ol li p find out what minimum requrements you want to put on a plugin writer then make one or more interfaces that the writer must implement for your code to know when and where to execute the code p li li p make an api the writer can use to access some of the functionality in your code p li ol p you could also make a base class the writer must inherit this will make wiring up the api easier then use some kind of reflection to scan a directory and load the classes you find that matches your requirements p p some people also make a scripting language for their system or implements an interpreter for a subset of an existing language this is also a possible route to go p p bottom line is when you get the code to load only your imagination should be able to stop you br good luck p 
276,2008-08-11T20:00:09Z, p this is generally something that you ll have to expose yourself so yes it will be dependent on the language your system is written in though often it s possible to write wrappers for other languages as well p p if for example you had a program written in c for windows plugins would be written for your program as dlls at runtime you would manually load these dlls and expose some interface to them for example the dlls might expose a code gimme_the_interface code function which could accept a structure filled with function pointers these function pointers would allow the dll to make calls register callbacks etc p p if you were in c you would use the dll system except you would probably pass an object pointer instead of a struct and the object would implement an interface which provided functionality accomplishing the same thing as the struct but less ugly for java you would load class files on demand instead of dlls but the basic idea would be the same p p in all cases you ll need to define a standard interface between your code and the plugins so that you can initialize the plugins and so the plugins can interact with you p p p s if you d like to see a good example of a c plugin system check out the a href http foobar com sdk html rel nofollow foobar sdk a i haven t used it in quite a while but it used to be really well done i assume it still is p 
277,2008-08-11T20:06:53Z, p i ve used event based apis for plugins in the past you can insert hooks for plugins by dispatching events and providing access to the application state p p for example if you were writing a blogging application you might want to raise an event just before a new post is saved to the database and provide the post html to the plugin to alter as needed p 
278,2008-08-11T20:15:06Z, p i m tempted to point you to the design patterns book for this generic question p p p seriously i think the answer is no you can t write extensible code by default it will be both hard to write extend and awfully inefficient mozilla started with the idea of being very extensible used xpcom everywhere and now they realized it was a mistake and started to remove it where it doesn t make sense p p what makes sense to do is to identify the pieces of your system that can be meaningfully extended and support a proper api for these cases e g language support plug ins in an editor you d use the relevant patterns but the specific implementation depends on your platform language choice p p imo it also helps to use a dynamic language makes it possible to tweak the core code at run time when absolutely necessary i appreciated that mozilla s extensibility works that way when writing firefox extensions p 
279,2008-08-11T20:38:25Z, p i think we are going to go the third party route i like the xsl html pdf printer flow winnovative s a href http www winnovative software com rel nofollow title cocoa programming for mac osx html to pdf a looks good for the first part but i m running into a block finding a good pdf printing solution any suggestions ideally the license would be on a developer basis not on a deployed runtime basis p 
280,2008-08-11T20:40:44Z, p if you are using a compiled language such as c or c it may be a good idea to look at plugin support via scripting languages both python and lua are excellent languages that are used to script a large number of applications civ and blender use python supreme commander uses lua etc p p if you are using c check out the boost python library otherwise python ships with headers that can be used in c and does a fairly good job documenting the c python api the documentation seemed less complete for lua but i may not have been looking hard enough either way you can offer a fairly solid scripting platform without a terrible amount of work it still isn t trivial but it provides you with a very good base to work from p 
281,2008-08-11T22:08:57Z, p printing from a service is a bad idea network printers are connected per user you can mark the service to be run as a particular user but i d consider that a bad security practice you might be able to connect to a local printer but i d still hesitate before going this route p p the best option is to have the service store the data and have a user launched application do the printing by asking the service for the data or a common location that the data is stored like a database p p if you need to have the data printed as regular intervals setup a task event thru the task scheduler launching a process from a service will require knowing the user name and password which again is bad security practice p p as for the printing itself use a third party tool to generate the report will be the easiest p

284,2008-08-12T02:37:15Z, p aha i was really just testing everyone once again the real answer is you rarely need to iterate the datagrid because even when binding to an arraylist the binding is way still it is handy to know how to itereate the grid directly it can save a few lines of code now and then p p but notmyself and orion gave the better answers convince the stakeholders to move up to a higher version of c to save development costs and increase maintainability and extensability p

310,2008-08-12T21:16:50Z, p i always create a separate assembly that contains p ul li a lot of small interfaces think icreaterepository ireadrepository ireadlistrepsitory the list goes on and most of them relies heavily on generics li li a lot of concrete interfaces like an ipersonrepository that inherits from ireadrepository you get the point br anything you cannot describe with just the smaller interfaces you put into the concrete interface br as long as you use the ipersonrepository to declare your object you get a clean consistent interface to work with but the kicker is you can also make a class that takes f x a icreaterepository in its constructor so the code will end up being very easy to do some really funky stuff with there are also interfaces for the services in the business tier here li li at last i stick all the domain objects into the extra assembly just to make the code base itself a bit cleaner and more loosely coupled these objects dont have any logic they are just a common way to describe the data for all layers li ul p btw why would you define methods in the business logic tier to accommodate the data tier br the data tier should have no reason to even know there is a business tier p

313,2008-08-12T21:28:09Z, p this is a classic problem separating your domain model from your database model there are several ways to attack it it really depends on the size of your project in my opinion you could use the repository pattern as others have said if you are using net or java you could use a href http www hibernate org html rel nofollow nhibernate a or a href http www hibernate org rel nofollow hibernate a p p what i do is use a href http en wikipedia org wiki test driven_development rel nofollow test driven development a so i write my ui and model layers first and the data layer is mocked so the ui and model is build around domain specific objects then later i map these object to what ever technology i m using the the data layer is a very bad idea to let the database determine the design of your app write the app first and think about the data later p p ps the title of the question is a little mis leading p

320,2008-08-13T06:08:24Z, p if i understand the question correctly you ve created a domain model and you would like to write an object relational mapper to map between records in your database and your domain objects however you re concerned about polluting your domain model with the plumbing code that would be necessary to read and write to your object s fields p p taking a step back you essentially have two choices of where to put your data mapping code within the domain class itself or in an external mapping class the first option is often called the active record pattern and has the advantage that each object knows how to persist itself and has sufficient access to its internal structure to allow it to perform the mapping without needing to expose non business related fields p p e g p pre code public class user private string name private accountstatus status private user public string name get return name set name value public accountstatus status get return status public void activate status accountstatus active public void suspend status accountstatus suspended public static user getbyid int id user fetcheduser new user lots of database and error checking code omitted for clarity fetcheduser name string reader name fetcheduser status int reader statuscode accountstatus suspended accountstatus active return fetcheduser public static void save user user code to save user s internal structure to database code pre p in this example we have an object that represents a user with a name and an accountstatus we don t want to allow the status to be set directly perhaps because we want to check that the change is a valid status transition so we don t have a setter fortunately the mapping code in the getbyid and save static methods have full access to the object s name and status fields p p the second option is to have a second class that is responsible for the mapping this has the advantage of seperating out the different concerns of business logic and persistence which can allow your design to be more testable and flexible the challenge with this method is how to expose the name and status fields to the external class some options are use reflection which has no qualms about digging deep into your object s private parts provide specially named public setters e g prefix them with the word private and hope no one uses them accidentally if your language suports it make the setters internal but grant your data mapper module access e g use the internalsvisibletoattribute in net onwards or friend functions in c p p for more information i d recommend martin fowler s classic book patterns of enterprise architecture p p however as a word of warning before going down the path of writing your own mappers i d strongly recommend looking at using a rd party object relational mapper orm tool such as nhibernate or microsoft s entity framework i ve worked on four different projects where for various reasons we wrote our own mapper and it is very easy to waste a lot of time maintaining and extending the mapper instead of writing code that provides end user value i ve used nhibernate on one project so far and although it has quite a steep learning curve initially the investment you put in early on pays off considerably p

375,2008-08-14T02:16:42Z, p in compiled languages the difference is stark p p java p pre code early binding public create_a_foo args return new foo args my_foo create_a_foo late binding public create_something class klass args klass new_instance args my_foo create_something foo code pre p in the first example the compiler can do all sorts of neat stuff at compile time in the second you just have to hope that whoever uses the method does so responsibly of course newer jvms support the code class lt gt klass code structure which can greatly reduce this risk p p another benefit is that ides can hotlink to the class definition since it s declared right there in the method the call to create em something foo might be _very em far from the method definition and if you re looking at the method definition it might be nice to see the implementation p p the major advantage of late binding is that it makes things like inversion of control easier as well as certain other uses of polymorphism and duck typing if your language supports such things p 
376,2008-08-14T02:21:56Z, p in interpreted languages the difference is a little more subtle p p ruby p pre code early binding def create_a_foo args foo new args end my_foo create_a_foo late binding def create_something klass args klass new args end my_foo create_something foo code pre p because ruby is generally not compiled there isn t a compiler to do the nifty up front stuff the growth of jruby means that more ruby is compiled these days though making it act more like java above p p the issue with ides still stands a platform like eclipse can look up class definitions if you hard code them but cannot if you leave them up to the caller p p inversion of control is not terribly popular in ruby probably because of its extreme runtime flexibility but rails makes great use of late binding to reduce the amount of configuration necessary to get your application going p 
377,2008-08-14T02:24:04Z, p the short answer is that early or static binding refers to compile time binding and late or dynamic binding refers to runtime binding for example when you use reflection p

399,2008-08-14T10:28:08Z, p one trick i ve found handy is to have my data layer be collection agnostic that is whenever i want to return a list of objects from my data layer i get the caller to pass in the list so instead of this p pre code public ilist lt gt getfoosbyid int id code pre p i do this p pre code public void getfoosbyid ilist lt gt foos int id code pre p this lets me pass in a plain old list if that s all i need or a more intelligent implementation of ilist lt gt like observablecollection lt gt if i plan to bind to it from the ui this technique also lets me return stuff from the method like a validationresult containing an error message if one occurred p p this still means that my data layer knows about my object definitions but it gives me one extra degree of flexibility p 
400,2008-08-14T10:28:20Z, p check out linq to sql if i were creating a new application right now i would consider relying on an entirely linq based data layer p p other than that i think it s good practise to de couple data and logic as much as possible but that isn t always practical a pure separation between logic and data access makes joins and optimisations difficult which is what makes linq so powerful p 
401,2008-08-14T10:28:43Z, p you can have both let data layer not know of your bussiness objects and make it capable of working with more than one type of data sources if you supply a common interface or an abstract class for interacting with data you can have different implementations for each type of data source factory pattern goes well here p

509,2008-08-16T01:07:35Z, p i m totally at a loss as to why some of you seem to think that throwing gobs of objects at the code is the way to go for example there are exactly four seasons and they don t em do em or em store em anything how does it simplify anything to make them objects wing is quite right that these should probably be strong em constants em strong or maybe enums p p what bruce needs at it s heart is simply a lookup table he doesn t need a hierarchy of objects and interfaces he needs a way to look up a schedule based on a season and a group identifier turning things into objects only makes sense if they have responsibilities or state if they have neither then they are simply identifiers and building special objects for them just makes the codebase larger p p you em could em build e g code group code objects that each contain a set of schedule strings one for each season but if all the code group code object does is provide lookup functionality then you ve reinvented the lookup table in a much less intuitive fashion if he has to look up the group and then lookup the schedule all he has is a two step lookup table that took longer to code is more likely to be buggy and will be harder to maintain p

514,2008-08-16T02:30:31Z, p in line with some of the other comments i would definately have a look at your indexing p p one thing i discovered earlier this year on our mysql databases was the power of composite indexes for example if you are reporting on order numbers over date ranges a composite index on the order number and order date columns could help i believe mysql can only use one index for the query so if you just had separate indexes on the order number and order date it would have to decide on just one of them to use using the explain command can help determine this p p to give an indication of the performance with good indexes including numerous composite indexes i can run queries joining tables in our database and get almost instant results in most cases for more complex reporting most of the queries run in under seconds these tables have million million and millions rows respectively note that we had also already normalised these slightly to speed up our most common query on the database p p more information regarding your tables and the types of reporting queries may allow further suggestions p

540,2008-08-16T17:56:47Z, p the problem is that you have code that first checks if it should create a new thread object and another piece of code that determines wether to start the thread object due to race conditions and similar things your code might end up trying to call start on an existing thread object considering you don t post the details behind the em check em variable it s impossible to know what might trigger this behavior p p you should reorganize your code so that start is guaranteed to only be called on new objects in short you should put the start method into the same if statement as the one that creates a new thread object p p personally i would try to reorganize the entire code so that i didn t need to create another thread but wrap the code inside the thread object inside a loop so that the thread just keeps on going p

549,2008-08-17T01:51:00Z, p the common standard for setting up subversion is to have three folders under the root of your repository trunk branches and tags the trunk folder holds your current main line of development for many shops and situations this is all they ever use just a single working repository of code p p the tags folder takes it one step further and allows you to checkpoint your code at certain points in time for example when you release a new build or sometimes even when you simply em make em a new build you tag a copy into this folder this just allows you to know exactly what your code looked like at that point in time p p the branches folder holds different kinds of branches that you might need in special situations sometimes a branch is a place to work on experimental feature or features that might take a long time to get stable therefore you don t want to introduce them into your main line just yet other times a branch might represent the production copy of your code which can be edited and deployed independently from your main line of code which contains changes intended for a future release p p anyway this is just one aspect of how to set up your system but i think giving some thought to this structure is important p

583,2008-08-18T12:40:52Z, p linq to sql p p sql server will cache the query plans so there s no performance gain for sprocs p p your linq statements on the other hand will be logically part of and tested with your application sprocs are always a bit separated and are harder to maintain and test p p if i was working on a new application from scratch right now i would just use linq no sprocs p 
584,2008-08-18T12:44:12Z, p i m assuming you mean linq to sql p p for any crud command it s easy to profile the performance of a stored procedure vs any technology in this case any difference between the two will be negligible try profiling for a simple types field object over select queries to find out if there s a real difference p p on the other hand the real deal breaker will be the question on whether you feel comfortable putting your business logic on your database or not which is an argument against stored procedures p 
585,2008-08-18T12:45:13Z, p the best code is no code and with stored procedures you have to write at least some code in the database and code in the application to call it whereas with linq to sql or linq to entities you don t have to write any additional code beyond any other linq query aside from instantiating a context object p 
586,2008-08-18T12:59:51Z, p i am generally a proponent of putting everything in stored procedures for all of the reasons dbas have been harping on for years in the case of linq it is true that there will be no performance difference with simple crud queries p p but keep a few things in mind when making this decision using any orm couples you tightly to your data model a dba has no freedom to make changes to the data model without forcing you to change your compiled code with stored procedures you can hide these sorts of changes to an extent since the parameter list and results set s returned from a procedure represent its contract and the innards can be changed around just so long as that contract is still met p p and also if linq is used for more complex queries tuning the database becomes a much more difficult task when a stored procedure is running slow the dba can totally focus on the code in isolation and has lots of options just so that contract is still satisfied when he she is done p p i have seen many many cases where serious problems in an application were addressed by changes to the schema and code in stored procedures without any change to deployed compiled code p p perhaps a hybird approach would be nice with linq linq can of course be used to call stored procedures p 
587,2008-08-18T13:08:31Z, p for basic data retrieval i would be going for linq without hesitation p p since moving to linq i ve found the following advantages p ol li debugging my dal has never been easier li li compile time safety when your schema changes is priceless li li deployment is easier because everything is compiled into dll s no more managing deployment scripts li li because linq can support querying anything that implements the iqueryable interface you will be able to use the same syntax to query xml objects and any other datasource without having to learn a new syntax li ol 
588,2008-08-18T13:32:51Z, blockquote p should i just do it when i m going to use it p blockquote p i would recommend that you only retrieve the data when you are going to use it if you are not going to need it there is no reason to waste resources by retrieving it in page_load if you are going to need it multiple times throughout the page load consider saving the query results to a private variable or collection so that the same data can be reused multiple times throughout the page load p blockquote p am i opening a new connection when i create a new instance p blockquote p asp net handles a href http msdn microsoft com en us library xx tyca vs aspx rel nofollow connection pooling a and opens and closes connections in an efficient way you shouldn t have to worry about this p p one other thing to consider from a performance perspective is to avoid using datasets and tableadapters in many cases they add a href http aspnet guysfromrolla com articles aspx rel nofollow extra overhead a into data retrieval that does not exist when using linq to sql stored procedures or datareaders p

590,2008-08-18T15:11:51Z, p i keep them the same but then i don t have multifile assemblies which is when the assemblyversion number becomes important i use microsoft style date encoding for my build numbers rather than auto incrementing i don t find the number of times that something has been built to be all that important p 
591,2008-08-18T15:20:59Z, p in a scenario where i have multiple file assemblies i e exe and dlls i will use a different file version for each but the same assembly version for all of them allowing you to know which exe each of the dlls go with p 
592,2008-08-18T15:42:29Z, p the key difference is in the viewstate management iirc the datagrid requires viewstate turned on in order to have edit and sort capabilities p 
593,2008-08-18T15:52:36Z, p if you re working in visual studio net you probably shouldn t use either use the listview it gives you the features of the gridview combined with the styling flexibility of a repeater p 
594,2008-08-18T15:55:13Z, p adam are you changing the file version with each build are you using version control syn or vss and using that information to link source back to the binaries p p seems to make sense that the assembly version stays the same i e that corresponds to the deployment of the product p p the file version changes to match the revision from the source control revision this would provide a link from a specific dll or exe to the source that built it p 
595,2008-08-18T16:03:33Z, p in solutions with multiple projects one thing i ve found very helpful is to have all the assemblyinfo files point to a single project that governs the versioning so my assemblyinfos have a line p pre code assembly assemblyversion foo staticversion bar code pre p i have a project with a single file that declares the string p pre code namespace foo public static class staticversion public const string bar code pre p my automated build process then just changes that string by pulling the most recent version from the database and incrementing the second last number p p i only change the major build number when the featureset changes dramatically p p i don t change the file version at all p

597,2008-08-18T17:25:54Z, p the kb article mentions the most important distinction file versions are only used for display purposes whereas the assembly version plays an important part in the net loading behaviour p p if you change the assembly version number then the identity of your assembly as a whole has changed developers will need to rebuild to reference your new version unless you put some auto versioning policy in place and at runtime only assemblies with matching version numbers will be loaded p p this is important in my environment where we need an incrementing highly visible version number for audit purposes but we don t want to force developers to rebuild or have many versions concurrently in production in this case for backwardly compatible minor changes we update the file version but not the assembly version p

605,2008-08-18T21:35:49Z, p here s something that i do in c c first off you write a function that uses the varargs stuff see the link in stu s posting then do something like this p pre code int debug_printf const char fmt if defined debug define debug_printf x debug_printf x else define debug_printf x endif debug_printf format string that takes s s n any number of args code pre p all you have to remember is to use double parens when calling the debug function and the whole line will get removed in non debug code p 
606,2008-08-18T21:42:09Z, p i still do it the old way by defining a macro xtrace below which correlates to either a no op or a function call with a variable argument list internally call vsnprintf so you can keep the printf syntax p pre code include lt gt void xtrace lpctstr lpsztext outputdebugstring lpsztext void xtrace lpctstr lpszformat va_list args va_start args lpszformat int nbuf tchar szbuffer get rid of this hard coded buffer nbuf _vsnprintf szbuffer lpszformat args outputdebugstring szbuffer va_end args code pre p then a typical ifdef switch p pre code ifdef _debug define xtrace xtrace else define xtrace endif code pre p well that can be cleaned up quite a bit but it s the basic idea p

611,2008-08-19T00:02:42Z, p the approach that i ve found works for me is having seperate js files for each class just as you would in java c and others alternatively you can group your js into application functional areas if that s easier for you to navigate p p if you put all your js files into one directory you can have your server side environment php for instance loop through each file in that directory and output a code lt gt code in some header file that is included by all your ui pages you ll find this auto loading especially handy if you re regularly creating and removing js files p p when deploying to production you should have a script that combines them all into one js file and minifies it to keep the size down p 
612,2008-08-19T00:09:03Z, p for server efficiency s sake it is best to combine all of your javascript into one minified file p p determine the order in which code is required and then place the minified code in the order it is required in a single file p p the key is to reduce the number of requests required to load your page which is why you should have all javascript in a single file for production p p i d recommend keeping files split up for development and then create a build script to combine compile everything p p also as a good rule of thumb make sure you include your javascript toward the end of your page if javascript is included in the header or anywhere early in the page it will stop all other requests from being made until it is loaded even if pipelining is turned on if it is at the end of the page you won t have this problem p

624,2008-08-19T06:08:31Z, p i also disagree about starting with the database the db is simply an artifact of how your business objects are persisted i don t know of an equivalent in java but net has stellar tools such as a href http subsonicproject com rel nofollow subsonic a that allow your db design to stay fluid as you iterate through your business objects design i d say first and foremost even before deciding on what technologies to introduce focus on the process and identify your nouns and verbs then build out from those abstractions hey it really does work in the real world just like oop taught you p

643,2008-08-19T14:28:23Z, blockquote p a dba has no freedom to make changes to the data model without forcing you to change your compiled code with stored procedures you can hide these sorts of changes to an extent since the parameter list and results set s returned from a procedure represent its contract and the innards can be changed around just so long as that contract is still met p blockquote p i really don t see this as being a benefit being able to change something in isolation might sound good in theory but just because the changes fulfil a contract doesn t mean it s returning the correct results to be able to determine what the correct results are you need context and you get that context from the calling code p 
644,2008-08-19T14:54:53Z, p there are a couple ways create an action for each step of the wizard process or create a parameter that is passed in to the action method like em step em that will allow you to know what the state of the wizard is in p 
645,2008-08-19T14:57:01Z, p it s all about the purpose of the db layer if you use an instance to access the db layer you are allowing multiple versions of that class to exist this is desirable if you want to use the same db layer to access multiple databases for example p p so you might have something like this p pre code dbcontroller acrhive new dbcontroller dev dbcontroller prod new dbcontroller prod code pre p which allows you to use multiple instances of the same class to access different databases p p conversely you might want to allow only one database to be used within your application at a time if you want to do this then you could look at using a static class for this purpose p 
646,2008-08-19T15:00:43Z, p it depends which model you subscribe to orm object relational model or interface model orm is very popular right now because of frameworks like nhibernate linq to sql entity framework and many others the orm lets you customize some business constraints around your object model and pass it around with out actually knowing how it should be committed to the database everything related to inserting updating and deleting happens in the object and doesn t really have to worry the developer too much p p the interface model like the enterprise data pattern made popular by microsoft requires you to know what state your object is in and how it should be handled it also requires you to create the necessary sql to perform the actions p p i would say go with orm p

652,2008-08-19T15:17:05Z, p the hash code of an object shouldn t be unique p p the checking rule is p ul li are the hash codes equal then call the full slow code equals code method li li are the hash codes not equal then the two items are definitely not equal li ul p all you want is a code gethashcode code algorithm that splits up your collection into roughly even groups it shouldn t form the key as the code hashtable code or code dictionary lt gt code will need to use the hash to optimise retrieval p p how long do you expect the data to be how random if lengths vary greatly say for files then just return the length if lengths are likely to be similar look at a subset of the bytes that varies p p code gethashcode code should be a lot quicker than code equals code but doesn t need to be unique p p two identical things em must never em have different hash codes two different objects em should not em have the same hash code but some collisions are to be expected after all there are more permutations than possible bit integers p 
653,2008-08-19T15:19:32Z, p is using the existing hashcode from the byte array field not good enough also note that in the equals method you should check that the arrays are the same size before doing the compare p 
654,2008-08-19T15:31:02Z, p generating a good hash is easier said than done remember you re basically representing n bytes of data with m bits of information the larger your data set and the smaller m is the more likely you ll get a collision two pieces of data resolving to the same hash p p the simplest hash i ever learned was simply xoring all the bytes together it s easy faster than most complicated hash algorithms and a halfway decent general purpose hash algorithm for small data sets it s the bubble sort of hash algorithms really since the simple implementation would leave you with bits that s only hashes not so hot you could xor chunks instead of individal bytes but then the algorithm gets much more complicated p p so certainly the cryptographic algorithms are maybe doing some stuff you don t need but they re also a huge step up in general purpose hash quality the md hash you re using has bits with billions and billions of possible hashes the only way you re likely to get something better is to take some representative samples of the data you expect to be going through your application and try various algorithms on it to see how many collisions you get p p so until i see some reason to not use a canned hash algorithm performance perhaps i m going to have to recommend you stick with what you ve got p

657,2008-08-19T15:59:41Z, p unless the method provides a limit parameter which it doesn t your best option is to go with a simple loop that removes the items that match breaking when your incremented match counter hits your limit p p that s pretty much how the internal function works anyway but in a more optimized way p 
658,2008-08-19T16:00:46Z, p in framework removeall method takes a predicate as a parameter so you may use p pre code list removeall item gt shouldiremovethis item code pre p where shouldiremovethis is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether the item must be removed from the list p

705,2008-08-19T23:17:07Z, p i don t think there are hard and fast rules for this type of thing but i usually go by the guideline of using the lightest possible way until absolutely necessary p p for example let s say you have a code person code class and a code group code class a code group code instance has many people so a list here would make sense when i declare the list object in code group code i will use an code ilist lt gt code and instantiate it as a code list code p pre code public class group private ilist lt gt people public group this people new list lt gt code pre p and if you don t even need everything in code ilist code you can always use code ienumerable code too with modern compilers and processors i don t think there is really any speed difference so this is more just a matter of style p 
706,2008-08-19T23:17:46Z, p in situations i usually come across i rarely use ilist directly p p usually i just use it as an argument to a method p pre code void processarraydata ilist almostanytypeofarray do some stuff with the ilist array code pre p this will allow me to do generic processing on almost any array in the net framework unless it uses ienumerable and not ilist which happens sometimes p p it really comes down to the kind of functionality you need i d suggest using the list class in most cases ilist is best for when you need to make a custom array that could have some very specific rules that you d like to encapsulate within a collection so you don t repeat yourself but still want net to recognize it as a list p 
707,2008-08-19T23:20:12Z, p if you re working within a single method or even in a single class or assembly in some cases and no one outside is going to see what you re doing use the fullness of a list but if you re interacting with outside code like when you re returning a list from a method then you only want to declare the interface without necessarily tying yourself to a specific implementation especially if you have no control over who compiles against your code afterward if you started with a concrete type and you decided to change to another one even if it uses the same interface you re going to break someone else s code unless you started off with an interface or abstract base type p 
708,2008-08-19T23:20:22Z, p you should use the interface only if you need it e g if your list is casted to an ilist implementation other than list this is true when for example you use nhibernate which casts ilists into an nhibernate bag object when retrieving data p p if list is the only implementation that you will ever use for a certain collection feel free to declare it as a concrete list implementation p 
709,2008-08-19T23:41:13Z, p it s always best to use the lowest base type possible this gives the implementer of your interface or consumer of your method the opportunity to use whatever they like behind the scenes p p for collections you should aim to use ienumerable where possible this gives the most flexibility but is not always suited p

810,2008-08-21T14:30:19Z, p the thing you need to be aware of and i m guessing you probably already are is that the guys doing the coding em should em know what they are doing depending on the personailties of the members of your team you should be able to find someone who is willing and able to explain any of the intricacies to you on an as required basis p p in my experience the biggest hinderence to a project is the pm who understands the project but not how to accomplish it not in itself a problem but who is also unwilling to listen to what his team tell him as with any project management accept that you can t know everything and be humble enough to ask for explanations where needed p 
811,2008-08-21T14:37:57Z, p the number one rule is do not just ask for status updates it is especially strong annoying strong when phrases like where are we on this are used if you aren t directly involved in the details then just make sure you have established communication times or plans so that you know whats going on rather than asking for updates p 
812,2008-08-21T16:16:07Z, p stack queue in js is a simple array which can be manipulated with code push val code code pop code code shift val code and code unshift code p 
813,2008-08-21T16:51:54Z, p you can strip out the tags with regular expressions just make sure that your expressions will not filter tags that were actually text if the text had b in the body of text it would appear as b in the rtf stream in other words you would match on b but not b p p you could probably take a short cut and filter out the header rtf tags look for the first occurrence of viewkind in the input then read ahead to the first space character you would remove all of the characters from the start of the text up to and including that space character that would strip out the rtf header information fonts colors etc p 
814,2008-08-21T17:03:22Z, p as far as i know and i m definately not a hacker you are completely fine really if someone wanted to they could exploit your code anyway clientside but i don t see how they could exploit your server side code using javascript unless you use server side javascript p 
815,2008-08-21T17:19:03Z, p i don t see where this lets them do anything that they couldn t do already by calling eval if there s a security hole being introduced here i don t see it p 
816,2008-08-21T17:24:41Z, p this isn t inherently dangerous but the moment you pass any user provided data into the function it s ripe for a code injection exploit that s worrisome and something i d avoid i think a better approach would be to only expose the functionality you em need em and nothing more p 
817,2008-08-21T17:39:40Z, p i would use a hidden richtextbox set the rtf member then retrieve the text member to sanitize the rtf in a well supported way then i would use manually inject the desired formatting afterwards p

823,2008-08-21T19:26:02Z, p generally when you need to do a sizeable or frequent queries to busy tables where read committed would possibly be blocked by locks from uncommited transactions but only when you can live with inaccurate data p p as an example on a gaming web site i worked on recently there was a summary display of some stats about recent games this was all based on dirty reads it was more important for us to include then exclude the transactional data not yet committed we knew anyway that few if any transactions would be backed out we felt that on average the data would be more accurate that way p 
824,2008-08-21T19:26:44Z, p use it if you want the data back right away and it is not that important if it is right br do not use if if the data is important to be correct or if you are doing updates with it p p also take a look at snapshot isolation which has been introduced in sql server p 
825,2008-08-21T19:28:31Z, p from a href http msdn microsoft com en us library aa sql aspx msdn a p blockquote p when this option is set it is possible to read uncommitted or dirty data values in the data can be changed and rows can appear or disappear in the data set before the end of the transaction p blockquote p simply put when you are using this isolation level and you are performing multiple queries on an active table as part of one transaction there is no guarantee that the information returned to you within different parts of the transaction will remain the same you could query the same data twice within one transaction and get different results this might happen in the case where a different user was updating the same data in the midst of your transaction this can obviously have severe ramifications for parts of your application that rely on data integrity p 
826,2008-08-21T19:30:02Z, p can you give us some more information on how you add the combo boxes to the jpanel this is a pretty common thing to do in swing so i doubt that it s a jvm issue but i guess anything is possible p p specifically i would double check to make sure you re not accessing the gui from any background threads in this case maybe you re reading the choices from a db or something and updating the jcombobox from a background thread which is a big no no in swing see swingutils invokelater p 
827,2008-08-21T19:43:22Z, p the problem with silverlight is that there s still a lot of people who don t have it installed also i m not sure how well your existing net developers will be able to leverage their existing skills if they are only familiar with more traditional server side net coding p p what are your reasons for pushing silverlight over flex if you have to ask the soflow community for reasons it seems odd that you would be so willing to push it p 
828,2008-08-21T19:52:34Z, p i think silverlight and xaml is preferable to actionscript and though i m not familiar with actionscript ide s i am familiar with vs and expression web blend and they are very good development environments and getting better all the time i would go with silverlight and i think the key to getting users to install the plug in is to have a good plug in detect page that explains what sl is and why they need it for an example of this go to a href http memorabilia hardrock com rel nofollow http memorabilia hardrock com a and try it with your sl plug in disabled p 
829,2008-08-21T19:58:15Z, p as kibbee hinted at above the argument of leveraging existing net developers doesn t hold much water it is impossible to be an expert in all facets of net development the platform is just too big the same goes for java the only thing silverlight has going for it from a skills perspective is that you can code in your favorite net language that advantage is fairly small if you are already doing any significant web development that utilizes javascript since action script is a variation so really to convert a programmer to either flex or silverlight is all about learning the platform s api p 
830,2008-08-21T20:00:19Z, p i think silverlight is most advantageous for companies that have net developers but noone with designer experience p p skill sets will be easier to find as far as finding c or vb developers vs finding actionscript guru s however there is the trade off p p design experience is an investment not only in designers with artistic skill but also in the knowledge and tools provided by adobe you can nearly guarantee that a professional designer uses a mac and has experience with adobe tools p p right now the silverlight designer tools are half baked and can be a headache for instance blend errors when trying to render any xaml containing an ivalueconverter this is problematic i have no idea what the adobe developer experience is i m sure it is as hairy p p so at this stage of the game it comes down to human resources p p if you have net experience and little invested in design skills go silverlight programming skills tools will be transferable if you have design experience and skill set go with flex designer skills tools will be transferable p p either way both client platforms require communication with services to get data so you will always leverage your existing programing expertise on the back end p p paraphrased a href http stackoverflow com users jon galloway rel nofollow jon s a opinion from a different point of view p p i think you should look at flex as a long term play just as adobe seems to be doing there s an obvious balance on when to use silverlight vs flex when you re concerned about reach and install base but here are more reasons flex is a good direction to move in p ol li p second mover advantage just as adobe built a better java applet with flash they re able to look at how you d design a runtime from scratch today they have the advantage of knowing how people use the web today something the inventors of existing client platforms could never have accurately guessed net can add features but they can t realistically chuck the platform and start over p li li p designer familiarity while flex air is a new programing model it s not entirely unfamiliar to designers they ll get the way flex works a lot more quickly than they ll understand firing up a new design environment with new feature poor tools and new animation paradigms p li li p being rid of the rgb color model in silverlight net was originally built for windows and it is at the core of how it works flex ditched a long time ago for an design centric model p li li p all your tools run on your mac nuff said p li li p cool features silverlight still has some catching up to do with flash on some obvious features like webcam mic integration or d graphics acceleration p li ol

840,2008-08-21T22:18:05Z, p so the really really big deal about linq has nothing to do with linq to sql it s about the enhancements it brought to the c language itself p 
841,2008-08-21T23:20:41Z, p linq is not just an orm system as jonathan pointed out it brings a lot of functional programming elements to c and it lets you do a lot of database y things in regular c code it s difficult to explain just how incredibly powerful that can be consider how much having solid well designed generic data structures such as list stack dictionary hash etc included in common frameworks has improved the state of development in modern languages precisely because using these data structures is very common and reducing the intellectual overhead of using them is a huge benefit linq doesn t do anything you can t do yourself but it makes a lot of operations a lot more straightforward and a lot easier p p consider the time honored example of removing duplicates from a non ordered list in a lower level language like c or c you d probably have to sort the list and maintain two indices into the list as you removed dupes in a language with hashes java c javascript perl etc you could create a hash where the keys are the unique values then extract the keys into a new list with linq you could just do this p pre code int data var uniquedata data groupby i gt i select g gt g key code pre

874,2008-08-22T16:47:52Z, p in most firewall setups the tcp connection will be torn down by the firewall if it is idle to conserve resources the idle timeout is probably not something you can control some will tear them down if they are idle and a resource limit is being hit p p most corp environments won t allow any machines to make an outbound tcp connection anyway p p also using this mechanism means you are going to have scaling problems i think more reliable solution is to queue up information and have your clients poll for them regularly utilize caching if possible such that a subsequent client poll will get the cached data from the customers proxy cache if they are using one p p if you have to push data in a timely manner in sub second land i e financial services then consider some messaging infrastructure such an nservicebus distributor on client side but that will require a customer install p p so have you tried using toredo having read that it would appear there it is prob too complicated for a user to setup p

879,2008-08-22T19:04:34Z, p i think the best thing to do here would be one both of two things p ol li rethink the design if its too complex find a less complex way li li stop trying to visualise it p just store the dimensions in question that you need to sum then do them one at a time once you have the base code then look at improving the efficiency of your algorithm li ol 
880,2008-08-22T19:13:10Z, p i beg to differ there is always another way p p and if you really em cannot em refactor then you need to break the problem down into smaller parts like i said establish which dimensions you need to sum then hit them one at a time p p also stop changing the edits they are correcting your spelling errors they are trying to help you p 
881,2008-08-22T19:13:50Z, p when you say you don t know how many dimensions there are how exactly are you defining the data structures p p at some point someone needs to create this array and to do that they need to know the dimensions of the array you can force the creator to pass in this data along with the array p p unless the question is to define such a data structure p 
882,2008-08-22T19:22:48Z, p i use it every time i refer to an instance variable even if i don t need to i think it makes the code more clear p

884,2008-08-22T19:23:16Z, p i tend to underscore fields with _ so don t really ever need to use this also r tends to refactor them away anyway p 
885,2008-08-22T19:23:34Z, p you should always use it i use it to diferantiate private fields and parameters because our naming conventions state that we don t use prefixes for member and parameter names and they are based on information found on the internet so i consider that a best practice p 
886,2008-08-22T19:26:06Z, p i only use it when absolutely necessary ie when another variable is shadowing another such as here p pre code class vector float x float y float z public vector float x float y float z this x x this y y this z z code pre p or as ryan fox points out when you need to pass this as a parameter p 
887,2008-08-22T19:26:37Z, p any time you need a reference to the current object p p one particularly handy scenario is when your object is calling a function and wants to pass itself into it p p example p pre code void onchange screen draw this code pre 
888,2008-08-22T19:29:03Z, p you re doing this in c c so you have an array of array of array you don t have to visualize dimensions since that isn t how the data is laid out in memory for a dimensional p pre code gt gt gt gt gt code pre p so why can t you iterate across the first one summing it s contents if you are trying to find the size then code sizeof array sizeof int code is a risky approach you must know the dimension to be able to process this data and set the memory up so you know the depth of recursion to sum here is some pseudo code of what it seems you should do p pre code sum n_matrix depth running_total if depth then foreach element in the array running_total elm else foreach element in the array running_total sum elm depth return running_total code pre 
889,2008-08-22T19:29:29Z, p not sure what the confusion is sites on your intranet are in the intranet zone web sites are in the internet zone and sites on your computer are in the local zone unless you ve specifically overridden something in the browser s preferences p 
890,2008-08-22T19:29:51Z, p i pretty much only use strong this strong when referencing a type property from inside the same type as another user mentioned i also underscore local fields so they are noticeable without needing strong this strong p 
891,2008-08-22T19:30:42Z, p it depends on the coding standard i m working under if we are using _ to denote an instance variable then this becomes redundant if we are not using _ then i tend to use this to denote instance variable p

894,2008-08-22T19:46:46Z, p i can t believe all of the people that say using it always is a best practice and such p p use this when there is ambiguity as in a href http stackoverflow com a corey s example a or when you need to pass the object as a parameter as in a href http stackoverflow com a ryan s example a there is no reason to use it otherwise because being able to resolve a variable based on the scope chain should be clear enough that qualifying variables with it should be unnecessary p p edit the c documentation on this indicates one more use besides the two i mentioned for the this keyword a href http msdn microsoft com en us library dk sz vs aspx for declaring indexers a p p edit juan huh i don t see any inconsistency in my statements there are instances when i would use the this keyword as documented in the c documentation and those are times when you actually em need em it sticking this in front of variables in a constructor when there is no shadowing going on is simply a waste of keystrokes and a waste of my time when reading it it provides no benefit p

946,2008-08-23T00:14:00Z, p one strategy you could use is mvcc multi value concurrency control in this scheme you never do updates to any of your tables you just do inserts maintaining version numbers for each record this has the advantage of providing an exact snapshot from any point in time and it also completely sidesteps the update lock problems that plague many databases p p but it makes for a huge database and selects all require an extra clause to select the current version of a record p

978,2008-08-23T15:06:40Z, p codingthewheel p blockquote p but to the extent that oop has been a waste of time i d say it s because of lack of programmer training compounded by the steep learning curve of learning a language specific oop mapping some people get oop and others never will p blockquote p i dunno if that s really surprising though i think that technically sound approaches lsp being the obvious thing make em hard to use em but if we don t use such approaches it makes the code brittle and inextensible anyway because we can no longer reason about it and i think the counterintuitive results that oop leads us to makes it unsurprising that people don t pick it up p p more significantly since software is already fundamentally too hard for normal humans to write reliably and accurately should we really be extolling a technique that is consistently taught poorly and appears hard to learn if the benefits were clear cut then it might be worth persevering in spite of the difficulty but that doesn t seem to be the case p 
979,2008-08-23T15:08:58Z, p sean p blockquote p however factoring out common finctionality into a base class then reusing that in other descendant classes is a deeply elegant thing imho p blockquote p but procedural developers have been doing that for decades anyway the syntax and terminology might differ but the effect is identical there is more to oop than reusing common functionality in a base class and i might even go so far as to say that that is hard to describe as oop at all calling the same function from different bits of code is a technique as old as the subprocedure itself p

987,2008-08-23T15:43:04Z, p relative to straight procedural programming the first fundamental tenet of oop is the notion of information hiding and encapsulation this idea leads to the notion of the strong em class em strong that seperates the interface from implementation these are hugely important concepts and the basis for putting a framework in place to think about program design in a different way and better i think way you can t really argue against those properties there is no trade off made and it is always a cleaner way to modulize things p p other aspects of oop including inheritance and polymorphism are important too but as others have alluded to those are commonly over used ie sometimes people use inheritance and or polymorphism because they can not because they should have they are powerful concepts and very useful but need to be used wisely and are not automatic winning advantages of oop p p relative to re use i agree re use is over sold for oop it is a possible side effect of well defined objects typically of more primitive generic classes and is a direct result of the encapsulation and information hiding concepts it is potentially easier to be re used because the interfaces of well defined classes are just simply clearer and somewhat self documenting p
